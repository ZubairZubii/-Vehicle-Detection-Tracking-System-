## 🚀 **Key Features**
- **Real-Time Detection**: Detects vehicles in videos and marks them with bounding boxes 🎯.
- **Segmentation**: Advanced segmentation of vehicles using YOLOv8 🚀.
- **Vehicle Count**: Automatically tracks and counts detected vehicles 📊.
- **Cropping & Saving**: Saves detected vehicles as images for further analysis 🖼️.
- **Flask Web Interface**: Easily upload videos via the web UI 🌐.
- **Customizable**: Adjust margins, upper detection limits, and stop detection dynamically 🛠️.


## 📂 **Project Structure**

```bash
.
├── uploads/             # Directory for uploaded video files
├── outputs/             # Directory where processed files are saved
├── templates/           # HTML templates (includes upload form)
├── app.py               # Main Flask application
├── requirements.txt     # Python dependencies
└── README.md            # This file ✨
```

## 🛠️ **Tech Stack**
- **Flask** - Lightweight web framework for Python
- **YOLOv8** - Deep learning-based object detection model
- **OpenCV** - Computer vision library for processing video frames
- **ffmpegcv** - High-performance video capturing with ffmpeg

## 🎯 **How It Works**
1. **Upload a Video**: The user uploads a video file through the web interface.
2. **Set Detection Parameters**: Customize detection areas by adjusting the margin and the upper limit.
3. **Vehicle Detection**: Vehicles are detected in real-time, segmented, and saved as cropped images.
4. **Download Output**: After processing, download the processed video and vehicle images.

## 🌟 **Installation & Setup**

1. **Clone this repository** 📂:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/vehicle-detection-system.git
    cd vehicle-detection-system
    ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment** 🐍:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3. **Install Dependencies** 📦:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Run the Flask App** ⚡:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

5. **Access the App** 🌐:
    Open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

## 🧩 **Configuration**
- **Margin**: Adjust the margin for vehicle detection via the interface.
- **Upper Limit**: Set the upper detection limit for vehicles.
- **Stop Processing**: Dynamically stop processing via the API.
